    "text": "An important caveat about understanding cancer is that treatment is not necessarily about “curing” the disease; to summarise Hank Green, a YouTuber who documented his diagnosis and treatment, of the 9000 Americans who develop Hodgkin Lymphoma, 900 die. “Boom, that’s your statistic right there, 10%, right? Nope, not really!”\nSurvival rates are not designed to be interpreted as simply as that; according to the CDC, such interpretations don’t take into account factors like the age of the individual at time of diagnosis, the duration of the disease, the stage of the cancer, and sophistication of available treatment and technology, and many other factors. Let’s take a look at some data to understand this better."

Essentially, each row tells us what the 5-year survival rate would be that year for a person who contracts that cancer.\nLet’s visualize:\n\nfive_yr %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = survival_rate, fill = race, colour = race)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_rain(alpha = .5) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())+ \n    labs(title = \"Survival rates of aspects of cancer over time\", subtitle = \"Race\")\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing non-finite values\n(`stat_half_ydensity()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing missing values (`geom_point_sorted()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfive_yr %>%\n     ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = survival_rate, fill = gender, colour = gender)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_rain(alpha = .5) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())+ \n    labs(title = \"Survival rates of aspects of cancer over time\", subtitle = \"Gender\")\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing non-finite values\n(`stat_half_ydensity()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing missing values (`geom_point_sorted()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfive_yr %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = cancer_type, y = survival_rate)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_violin() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))+ \n    labs(title = \"Survival rates of aspects of cancer over time\", subtitle = \"Cancer type\")\n\nWarning: Removed 221 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data appear to be a bit of a mish mosh, but remember that this is over time. Let’s try and put that in perspective by making something similar to the original plot.\nLet’s take a look at leukemia for example:\n\nfive_yr %>%\n    filter(cancer_type == \"Leukemia\") %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = survival_rate, colour = race)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_grid(gender~cancer_type)\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows an upward trend overall, but there wouldn’t be enough reasonable room to plot each and every combination of variables. We should reasonably compress some of them. I’m going to assume that we wouldn’t be missing out on too much if we ignored intermittent downward trends, so maybe it would be interesting to see the change in survival rate over time?"

We can now see that improvement varies by race, gender, and cancer type, with some survival rates actually decreasing over time. That’s worrying. Let’s plot this to see the full gambit:\n\nfive_yr %>%\n    filter(!is.na(survival_rate)) %>%\n    group_by(race, gender, cancer_type) %>%\n    summarise(survival_rate_change = last(survival_rate) - first(survival_rate)) %>%\n    arrange(survival_rate_change) -> five_yr_change\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'race', 'gender'.

Why would this be?"

Let’s see the distribution of data:\n\ndf %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x=LUNG_CANCER)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\nThis is imbalanced data for sure, as we can see there are multiple positive cases of lung cancer than negative. We’ll keep this in mind for later. For now, let’s see if there’s any noticeable distribution differences in the two classes:\n\ndf %>%\n    group_by(LUNG_CANCER) %>%\n    skim()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n309\n\n\nNumber of columns\n16\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n14\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nLUNG_CANCER\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nLUNG_CANCER\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGENDER\nNO\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nGENDER\nYES\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nLUNG_CANCER\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nAGE\nNO\n0\n1\n60.74\n9.63\n21\n57\n61.0\n65.5\n87\n▁▁▇▇▁\n\n\nAGE\nYES\n0\n1\n62.95\n7.97\n38\n58\n62.5\n69.0\n81\n▁▃▇▇▂\n\n\nSMOKING\nNO\n0\n1\n1.49\n0.51\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nSMOKING\nYES\n0\n1\n1.57\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▆▁▁▁▇\n\n\nYELLOW_FINGERS\nNO\n0\n1\n1.33\n0.48\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nYELLOW_FINGERS\nYES\n0\n1\n1.60\n0.49\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nANXIETY\nNO\n0\n1\n1.31\n0.47\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nANXIETY\nYES\n0\n1\n1.53\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nPEER_PRESSURE\nNO\n0\n1\n1.26\n0.44\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.5\n2\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nPEER_PRESSURE\nYES\n0\n1\n1.54\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nCHRONIC DISEASE\nNO\n0\n1\n1.36\n0.49\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▅\n\n\nCHRONIC DISEASE\nYES\n0\n1\n1.53\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nFATIGUE\nNO\n0\n1\n1.49\n0.51\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nFATIGUE\nYES\n0\n1\n1.70\n0.46\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▃▁▁▁▇\n\n\nALLERGY\nNO\n0\n1\n1.13\n0.34\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nALLERGY\nYES\n0\n1\n1.62\n0.49\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nWHEEZING\nNO\n0\n1\n1.23\n0.43\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▂\n\n\nWHEEZING\nYES\n0\n1\n1.60\n0.49\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nALCOHOL CONSUMING\nNO\n0\n1\n1.18\n0.39\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▂\n\n\nALCOHOL CONSUMING\nYES\n0\n1\n1.61\n0.49\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nCOUGHING\nNO\n0\n1\n1.26\n0.44\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.5\n2\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nCOUGHING\nYES\n0\n1\n1.63\n0.48\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nSHORTNESS OF BREATH\nNO\n0\n1\n1.56\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▆▁▁▁▇\n\n\nSHORTNESS OF BREATH\nYES\n0\n1\n1.65\n0.48\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▅▁▁▁▇\n\n\nSWALLOWING DIFFICULTY\nNO\n0\n1\n1.13\n0.34\n1\n1\n1.0\n1.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nSWALLOWING DIFFICULTY\nYES\n0\n1\n1.52\n0.50\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▇\n\n\nCHEST PAIN\nNO\n0\n1\n1.31\n0.47\n1\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n2\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nCHEST PAIN\nYES\n0\n1\n1.59\n0.49\n1\n1\n2.0\n2.0\n2\n▆▁▁▁▇\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like fatigue, yellow fingers, allergies, alcohol consumption, and swallowing difficulty are are likely going to be particularly discriminant in differentiating the diagnoses, because they have noticeable imbalance for each case in the histograms."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOne of the most important aspects of disease prediction, especially for a disease like cancer, is that your models should ultimately be attempting to reduce harmful errors. In this case, false negatives would be devastating as they can be costly. In this experiment, I found using the F-measure to be a good metric as it let’s us measure not just accuracy, but also the likelihood of making such errors (called Recall in this example).\nThe final model underperformed in this respect, but I’m sure given some more time, there is an ideal model and parameter set that would reduce false negatives."
